Hi, I'm Marika, a full-stack developer with a passion for backend development. 

- 🔭  I enjoy using my skills to build the logic and functionality behind web and mobile applications. Troubleshooting backend issues and crafting elegant solutions is what drives me.
- ☁️ I'm also highly interested in cloud engineering, and I've solidified my practical experience with three AWS certifications and as a member of the AWS Community Builders program (Serverless category).
- 🌱 I'm currently diving into AI development, experimenting with building agents and integrating use cases for large language models (LLMs).
